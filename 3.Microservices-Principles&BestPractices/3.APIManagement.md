### What is an API Gateway?

An API Gateway is a single entry point that sits in front of your microservices and handles all client requests.

It acts as a reverse proxy â€” receiving incoming requests, routing them to the appropriate backend service, and then returning the response.

ðŸ”§ What it handles:
- Routing:
Sends each request to the correct service (/user â†’ UserService, /orders â†’ OrderService)

- Authentication & Authorization:
Verifies tokens or credentials before letting the request hit internal services.

- Rate Limiting & Throttling:
Protects downstream services from overload by capping requests.

- Load Balancing:
Can distribute traffic across multiple instances of a service.

- Request/Response Transformation:
Modify headers, aggregate data, or convert between formats.

- Logging & Monitoring:
Central place to log and trace requests end-to-end.

" The API Gateway acts as an abstraction layer that exposes a unified entry point to clients and hides internal microservice IPs and topology.
Clients never talk to services directly â€” they only talk to the gateway."



### Load Balancer:
A load balancer distributes traffic across multiple instances of the same service to improve availability and scalability.
