### Databases in microservices

In microservices, each service is ideally independently deployable and owned, and that includes owning its data.

But when multiple services share the same database schema, several problems arise:

ðŸ”´ Key Problems:
- Tight coupling across services:
Schema changes by one team can unintentionally break other services.

- This violates the independence principle of microservices.

- No clear ownership:
When multiple services write to the same tables, debugging issues becomes a nightmare.

- Who owns the customer table? Who's responsible for data consistency?

- Deployment blockers:
You canâ€™t deploy one service independently if your schema migration might affect another service.

- Hard to evolve or refactor:
Want to refactor a table structure or migrate to a new data model?
Youâ€™ll have to coordinate across teams, often slowing down development.

- Performance interference:
One service running a heavy query can slow down the database for everyone else â€” leading to cascading latency issues.

- Security & access control issues:
Itâ€™s harder to implement fine-grained access control when multiple services have blanket access to shared tables.

### Best Practice:
Instead of a shared DB, use **database-per-service**.
Services communicate through APIs or event-driven architecture (e.g. Kafka) for data exchange,
not direct DB access.

If shared DB is unavoidable temporarily, ensure read-only access, strict boundaries, and a clear ownership model.

### Cons:

- definitely adds a performance overhead - as the microservices need to make network calls to each other
- this performance overhead can usually be minimized via caching data locally
- if we do cache, we of course lose strict consistency and has to settle with eventual consistency
- performing distributed transactions is really complex and although theoretically possible,it is never really used in practice
