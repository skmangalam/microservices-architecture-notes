### challenges with using shared libs in microservice:

- changes to the library becomes tightly coupled with the microservices.
changes need to be communicated to all the teams using that library.
- every change in the library will need to rebuild/retested/redeployed
- bug/vulnerability will affect all microservices
- situations like dependency hell can occur

"We prefer clear ownership and service isolation.
For utility logic, shared libraries make sense.
But we avoid putting business logic into them to reduce coupling and keep services deployable independently."

Rather than putting the business logic in a shared library, boundaries of the microservices
should be adjusted and the shared library should be moved inside one of them

Also, if the shared library is big enough, we should consider converting it as a separate
microservice itself


#### where is it a good practice?

- when we need to share common data models for communication between microservices
- even duplicating the code in different microservices is ok involving utility methods
