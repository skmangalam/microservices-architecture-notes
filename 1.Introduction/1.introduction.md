### Motivation for microservices:

* When done correctly:
  - Allow organizations to scale to 1000s of engineers
  - Reach billions of customers
  - Keep operational costs low
  - Stay efficient and innovative

### Monolithic architecture
Monolithic architecture is where the entire application â€” UI, business logic, and data access â€” is packaged,
deployed, and run as a single unit.
It typically results in one large codebase and a single deployment artifact like a .jar or .war.

While it's simple to develop initially, it becomes problematic as the system grows.

ðŸ”´ Problems with Monoliths:
- Scalability bottleneck:
You can't scale specific features independently. For example, if only the reporting module needs more resources, you still have to scale the whole app.

- Tight coupling and codebase complexity:
Modules are interdependent. A small change in one part can have unintended side effects elsewhere, making the system fragile and hard to maintain.

- Slow deployments:
Even minor changes require redeploying the entire application, which increases risk and downtime.

- Tech stack rigidity:
Youâ€™re locked into one set of tools or frameworks across all modules, making it hard to evolve parts of the system independently.

- Poor fault isolation:
If one component fails â€” say, the payment module â€” it can crash the entire system since everything runs as a single process.

### Microservices achitecture
Microservices architecture organizes the business logic as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployed services.
Each service is owned by a small team and has a narrow scope of responsibility.

#### Benefits of microservices:

- Higher organizational stability
- Higher system scalability

#### Challenges

- microservices are highly distributed
- method calls becomes network calls between two different services - can add latency, network issues
- the very nature of distributed system makes the microservices unreliable
- testing can be challenging as well where there is no guarantee that all the microservices once deployed will work correctly
together as a whole
- troubleshooting and debugging becomes harder
