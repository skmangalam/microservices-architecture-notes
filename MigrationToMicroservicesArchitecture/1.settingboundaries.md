### Principles of setting boundaries of each microservice

- Cohesive:
Elements that are tightly related to each other and change together should stay together
- Single Responsibility Principle:
Every microservice should do one thing and do it exceptionally well
- Loose coupling:
Loosely coupled microservices have very little to no dependencies. Each microservice can perform its functionality
with minimal communication with other microservices

As long as the microservices are:
- cohesive
- follows SRP
- loosely coupled

Their size does not matter.
