There are 2 ways using which we should decompose a monolith into microservices:

- Decomposition by business capabilities
- Decomposition by domain/subdomains

### Business capability:
This technique looks at the system from the business side
- any core capability that provides value to:
  - business
  - customers
- E.g: revenue, marketing, customer experience etc.
- once we identify those business capabilities, we can dedicate a separate microservice and a team
to fully own it.
- For example: consider an online store:
  - browse through products -> web app service
  - search/view products -> products service
  - read the reviews -> review service
  - place orders -> order service
  - shipping of the product -> shipping service
  - maintain product inventory -> inventory service


### Domain/Subdomain:
This technique looks at the system from developer's point of view
In other words, the criteria of setting the boundaries of subdomains is based on the
engineer's understanding of the system
These subdomain can be of three types:
- Core: A domain that represents the core business capability
  - Product catalog
- Supporting: A domain that is supporting a business capability
  - Orders, Inventory, Shipping
- Generic: A generic subdomain is a capability that is not specific any business
  - Reviews, payments, search, images, image compression, security, web UI
