Two approach:

### Big Bang Approach
- map out the microservices boundaries.
- stop any development of new features and fully focus on migration.
- it is not a good approach as all the developers are busy on the migration
and it is detrimental to the business since no new features are being added.

### Incremental and continuous approach
- Identify the components that can benefit most from the migration such as
areas with most frequent changes, components with high scalability requirements,
components with the least technical debt.

- No hard deadlines necessary
- Consistent, visible progress
- Business is not disrupted

###  migration:
- must ensure the codebase has good test coverage before migration
- execute the migration using the strangler fig pattern

Strangler Fig pattern:
This pattern is inspired by a plant that starts as a small vine growing on top
and alongside an existing old tree. And then overtime, it grows and expands and fully
consumes the old tree taking its place.

- First introduce a proxy in front of the monolithic application.
This proxy is called the Strangler Facade.
- Once the newly developed microservice has been thoroughly tested, we divert the traffic
for that API from the monolith to the microservice.
- After monitoring the microservice for a certain period of time, we remove the old
component with the same functionality from the monolith application.
- We repeat it for all the other microservices.
